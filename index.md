Hi there, I'm Niklas!

I'm a Full Professor of Information Systems and Human-Centric Artificial Intelligence at the University of Bayreuth. I am also a Group Leader at the IS branch of the Fraunhofer FIT, Director at the Research Center Finance & Information Management (FIM), Senior Expert AI at IBM, and an Associated Researcher at the KIT. In addition to my academic background, I have practical experience as a Managing Consultant in Data Science at IBM. 

The focus of my research is on human-centric artificial intelligence. I strongly believe two core competencies are necessary for inventive AI applications and their successful, fair, and robust adaptation in the market: The technology perspective (deep knowledge of machine learning methods) and the human perspective (deep knowledge of human-centric design methods). 

Only in their interdisciplinary combination in developing socio-technical systems can they unfold their full potential and provide benefits in later applications. This interplay also reveals important research avenues that need to be further explored. For me, these currently include human-AI teamwork, appropriate reliance on AI decisions, fairness in AI decision-making, and societal implications and benefits of AI. 

I aim to explore these principles further and communicate them to students, industry, and society.
